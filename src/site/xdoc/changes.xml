    <release version="4.1" date="TBD"
             description="TBD">
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" >
        the gravity coefficients for solar system bodies are now extracted from JPL files headers
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        the eventOccurred method in EventDetector interface and its various implementations
        has an additional parameter specifying if the switching function increases or
        decreases at event time. This allows simpler events identification has many switching
        functions have two switches (start/end, raising/setting, entry/exit ...). Note that
        this changes breaks compatibility for users that did implement their own events, but
        it is simple to deal with (simply add one parameter in the signature and ignore it)
        so its was considered acceptable.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" due-to="Christophe Pipo">
        fixed an error occurring when DE406 JPL ephemerides were loaded before DE405 ones
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" due-to="Sébastien Herbinière">
        fixed an error in EGM potential file loader
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        trigger exceptions when no data can be loaded
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        remove predefined leap seconds, they are not useful anymore since other
        parts of the library do need configuration data (solar system bodies) and
        since data configuration has been vastly improved
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" due-to="quinput and Kai Ruhl">
        Re-activated a way to put configuration data in the classpath using a
        data provider plugin.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added a way to load configuration data directly from network (either
        locally or through a proxy server) using a data provider plugin.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added a small plugin-like mechanism to delegate configuration data
        loading to a user-provided mechanism, thus enabling smooth integration
        in existing systems.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Updated to latest version of commons-math.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" due-to="Silvia Ríos Bergantiños">
        Added galician localization for error messages.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" due-to="Guylaine Prat">
        Improved javadoc comments in orbit classes.
      </action>
      <action dev="pascal" type="add">
        Tidal corrections are now available for ITRF and TIRF frames. Both frames are
        provided in two versions, the standard one with tidal corrections and a stripped
        down one without tidal corrections. A cache/interpolation mechanism is used to
        keep the computation cost of tidal correction to a minimum. With this mechanism,
        the penalty to use tidal correction is slightly above 20% in run time for a
        transformation between GCRF and ITRF. A raw implementation without this mechanism
        would lead to a 550% penalty, or even a 1100% penalty if TIRF and ITRF parts were
        computed independently.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="4.0" date="2008-10-13"
             description="major upgrade with new features (GCRF and ITRF2005 frames, DE 405
             and DE 406 ephemerides support, improved and greatly simplified date/time support,
             vastly improved data configuration with zip files support, new tutorials, improved
             performances, more tests and all identified bugs fixed, new translation files for
             italian, spanish and norse.">
      <action dev="pascal" type="fix">
        The ephemeris produced by numerical propagator now checks date validity in
        propagate method.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        The EME2000/J2000 frame was slightly mis-oriented (about 20 milli arcseconds).
        It really was the GCRF frame. This has been fixed and now both the GCRF and
        the EME2000/J2000 are available.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        Dates in UTC within leap seconds are now displayed correctly (i.e. a 61st
        second is added to the minute).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" due-to="quinput">
        Fixed an overflow error in AbsoluteDate that generated an exception when any
        attempts was made to print dates far away like AbsoluteDate.JULIAN_EPOCH or
        AbsoluteDate.MODIFIED_JULIAN_EPOCH.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        Changed test configuration to always use a new JVM for each test. This prevents
        some false positive to be generated.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The GeodeticPoint constructor arguments has been reordered to reflect more
        traditional usage, latitude coming before longitude.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The low accuracy Sun model based on Newcomb theory and the Moon model based
        on Brown theory have been withdrawn as they are superseded by the support of JPL
        DE 405 binary ephemerides files.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The ThirdBody abstract class has been removed and its specific method
        getMu has been moved up into CelestialBody interface and
        renamed getGM.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Improved external data configuration. The java property is now called
        orekit.data.path and is a colon or semicolon separated path containing
        directories or zip archives, themselves containing embedded directories
        or zip archives and data files. This allows easy roll-out of system-wide
        configuration data that individual users can override by prepending their
        own data trees in front of the path. This also allows simple configuration
        since many data files can be stored in easy to handle zip archives.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Renamed the iers package into data, as it is not IERS specific anymore. Some
        classes where also moved out of the package and into the frame and time
        package and their visibility reduced to package only. This improves decoupling
        and reduces clutter on users by limiting the number of visible classes.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The performance of IAU-2000 precession-nutation model computation has been
        tremendously improved, using a combined caching and interpolation approach. The
        simplified model (which was quite inaccurate in version 3.1) has therefore been
        removed as it was not needed anymore.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The ITRF 2005 frame is now supported instead of the older ITRF 2000 frame. The
        Earth Orientation Parameters data handling classes have been updated to match
        this change and read the new file format provided by IERS.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The J2000 frame has been renamed as EME2000 as this name seems to be more
        widely accepted and reduces confusion with the J2000.0 epoch. The
        Frame.getJ2000() method is still available, but has been deprecated
        and will be removed in the future.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Changed TimeScale from base abstract class to interface only.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Renamed some classes for better understanding: ChunkedDate is now DateComponents,
        ChunkedTime is now TimeComponents, ChunksPair is now DateTimeComponents. The
        getChunks method from AbsoluteDate as also been renamed into getComponents accordingly.
      </action>
      <action dev="pascal" type="add">
        Added new tutorials.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added predefined local orbital frames: the (t, n, w) frame aligned with velocity
        and the (q, s, w) frame aligned with position.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added a predefined detector for altitude crossing events.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added methods to get zenith, nadir, north, south, east and west direction for
        any GeodeticPoint.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" due-to="Silvia Ríos Bergantiños">
        Added spanish localization for error messages.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" due-to="Espen Bj&#248;rntvedt">
        Added norse localization for error messages.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" due-to="Francesco Coccoluto">
        Added italian localization for error messages.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" due-to="Derek Surka">
        Added support for mean motion first and second derivatives fields in TLE.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added a way to rebuild the two lines of TLE instances.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" due-to="Derek Surka">
        Added constructor from already parsed elements for TLE.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added a method to retrieve a body-centered inertial frame to the
        CelestialBody interface. As a consequence, thirteen new frames are
        predefined: Sun, Moon, planets and barycenters provided by JPL binary
        ephemerides.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Support for the JPL DE 405 and DE 406 binary ephemerides files has been added
        and a factory class SolarSystemBody uses these files to provide implementations
        of the CelestialBody interface for Sun, Moon, the eight solar system
        planets,the Pluto dwarf planet as well as the solar system barycenter and Earth-Moon
        barycenter points.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        The CelestialBody interface now provides velocity as well as position.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        A getCalls() method has been added to the NumericalPropagator class to count the
        number of calls to the differential equations computation method. This helps
        tuning the underlying integrator settings in order to improve performances.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        A lot more classes and interfaces are now serializable, to help users embed
        instance in their own serializable classes.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added predefined leap seconds to allow proper turn-key use of the library
        even without an already configured environment. All known leap seconds at
        time of writing (2008) are predefined, from 1972-01-01 to 2009-01-01 (the
        last one has been announced in Bulletin C 36 on 2008-07-04 and is not yet
        present in the UTC-TAI.history published file)
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Improved user-friendliness of the time-scales by changing methods parameters
        types to more easily understandable ones.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Improved user-friendliness of the AbsoluteDate class by adding several
        new constructors and methods for common cases. It is in particular now possible
        to use offsets within a time scale, for example to build a date given as a
        fractional number of days since a reference date in UTC, explicitly ignoring
        intermediate leap seconds.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Improved the class handling date/time components: added a constructor to allow building
        from an offset with respect to a reference epoch, implemented Comparable interface and
        added equals and hashCode methods.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Improved the class handling date components: added a constructor to allow building
        from any reference epoch, not only J2000.0 (thus simplifying use of modified julian day),
        added getMJD() method, added several constants JULIAN_EPOCH, MODIFIED_JULIAN_EPOCH,
        FIFTIES_EPOCH, GPS_EPOCH, J2000_EPOCH and JAVA_EPOCH.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added a new time scale: GPSScale.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added the changes page to the generated site.
      </action>
