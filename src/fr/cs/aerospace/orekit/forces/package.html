This package provides interfaces that will be used by the 
{@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.propagation.NumericalPropagator}.

<p>
The {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.forces.ForceModel} instance is added to the propagator 
before the extrapolation. The propagator calls at each step the 
{@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.forces.ForceModel#addContribution(AbsoluteDate, PVCoordinates, Frame, double, AttitudeKinematics, fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.propagation.TimeDerivativesEquations)}
method, giving all the state information it needs : date, position, velocity, frame, 
attitude, mass and above all the {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.propagation.TimeDerivativesEquations}
 instance. The selected force model 
calculates then the acceleration relative to the model and state, and adds it to the 
Gauss equations. 
</p>
<p>
A useful object has been developed to handle the discontinuities of the acceleration 
(typically for maneuvers or solar drag for instance): the 
{@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.forces.SWF switching functions}. The g 
function method is called at each step and must return a double. The integrator is 
looking for its change of sign, it means that a particular step must coincide with the 
g function sign change, so that no important event can be missed. A force model can 
use several switching functions or not at all.
