ORbital Extraplotation KIT.

<h2> 1. Purpose </h2>
<p> 
	OREKIT library is a multiple tool provider for space mechanics projects. It is 
implemented in JAVA 1.4 language. 
</p>
<p>
	OREKIT project was initiated by CS for several reasons : <br>
 - some space mechanics softwares are implemented in C/C++ language, and a large 
proportion of the engineers are still using FORTRAN90 or even FORTRAN77 to code 
their calculators. OREKIT innovates with the JAVA object oriented language, 
which opens many possibilities and facilitates significantly the software use and support. <br>
 - OREKIT wants to be a efficient and progressive tool, and provides some of the most
recent physical models such as earth fixed frame and smart and precise numerical
propagators. <br> 
 - if it exists many orbital extrapolation tools, their complexity rises as well as 
their size and the number of their functionalities. And, for most of the users the 
biggest issue is to get an easy and affordable access to these expensive and protected
tools. OREKIT has been structured and developed to reduce as much as possible all of
these problems, and provides simple and efficient tools for different uses.
</p>
<p>
	It can be used for many purposes, starting from simple geometrical or orbital tools, 
ending with the propagation of orbits with several perturbation forces and maneuvers.
Here is a short list of the possibilities offered by the library : <br>
 - <strong>frames and transform handling</strong>. Rotations, translations, position 
 and velocity transform... <br>
 - <strong>time and instants handling</strong>. Absolute dates comparison, epoch and 
 time scales models... <br>
 - <strong>space mechanics objects implementation</strong>. Moon, Sun, terrestrial 
 frame ITRF2000, forces (gravity attraction field, third body attraction, 
 sun and atmospheric drag, maneuvers...) <br>
 - <strong>orbits representation</strong>. Orbital parameters conversions (Keplerian,
 Circular, Cartesian, Equinoctial), Keplerian extrapolation, simple attitudes.<br>
 - <strong>numerical extrapolation</strong>. Numerical solutions to Gauss's equations, 
 with perturbing forces and maneuvers. 
</p>

<h2> 2. The use of JAVA as a scientific tool </h2>
<p>
	OREKIT is compatible with JAVA version 1.4 and followers and is designed to 
integrate technical projects as a solid and efficient base.
</p>
<p>
	It is clearly not common to use JAVA for scientific softwares, and too often 
for the wrong reasons. First of all, JAVA and the object oriented language permits
a fast, convivial and agile development. With the help of graphical interfaces, 
the very numerous available libraries, the plug ins and more, JAVA has proved itself 
very useful and practical. It is used by a large community of users on free software
development : web and database applications, graphics, interfaces...
<p>  
	So, why should it be kept away from scientific and mathematical use ? One of the
most heard argument is its slowness. That's only partially true. JAVA is not as slow as
some people would say, especially since the improved handling of garbage collector and
compilation. And, furthermore, with the growing capacities of our calculators, fastness
cannot be restricting anymore, especially in space mechanics which requires relatively
simple calculus. 
</p>
<p>
	OREKIT and JAVA are completely adapted to pre-mission analysis and on ground softwares. 
</p>

<h2> 3. MANTISSA </h2>
<p>
	OREKIT uses a free ware library, MANTISSA ( 
<ahref="http://www.spaceroots.org"> ), which provides mathematical tools for many purposes:
geometry, polynomial equations, differential equations, and more... 
</p>
<p>
	OREKIT is based on two MANTISSA packages : <br> 
 - {@link org.spaceroots.mantissa.geometry}, which provides very useful objects as vectors
   and rotations (internally represented by quaternions). <br>
 - {@link org.spaceroots.mantissa.ode}, which provides numerical solutions to solve 
   Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE).
</p>   
<p>
	The use of MANTISSA is hide in OREKIT as much as possible so the user doesn't 
have to worry about his understanding of this library. 
He will have to manipulate essentially the simple classes {@link org.spaceroots.mantissa.geometry.Vector3D},
{@link org.spaceroots.mantissa.geometry.Rotation}, and {@link org.spaceroots.mantissa.ode.FirstOrderIntegrator}. 
</p>

<h2> 4. Library description </h2>

<p> There are 4 ground packages : <br>
 - {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.time}, which is independant 
  (exept for {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.utils.PVCoordinates}). <br>
 - {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.frames}, which uses {@link org.spaceroots.mantissa.geometry}
   and {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.iers}
 -
