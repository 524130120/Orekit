This package provides tools to propagate orbital states with different methods.
	
<p> Propagation is the prediction of the evolution of an initial state.
 This initial state is represented in OREKIT by a 
 {@link fr.cs.orekit.propagation.SpacecraftState}, which is a 
 simple container for all needed information : mass, 
 {@link fr.cs.orekit.utils.PVCoordinates kinematics}, 
 {@link fr.cs.orekit.attitudes.Attitude attitude}, 
 {@link fr.cs.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate date}, 
 {@link fr.cs.orekit.frames.Frame frame}. Several ways to 
 calculate this prediction and store its results are proposed to the user.
</p>

<p> <h5> Keplerian propagation </h5> The {@link fr.cs.orekit.propagation.analytical.KeplerianPropagator}
 implements the {@link fr.cs.orekit.propagation.Propagator} 
 interface, which ensures that we can obtain a propagated SpacecraftState 
 at any time once the instance is initialized with an initial state. 
 This extrapolation is not a problem with a simple 
 {@link fr.cs.orekit.orbits.EquinoctialOrbit} 
 representation: only the mean anomaly value changes.
</p>

<p> <h5> Eckstein-Hechler propagation </h5>	
  This analytical model is suited for near circular orbits and inclination
  neither equatorial nor critical. It considers J2 to J6 potential 
  coefficients correctors, and uses mean parameters to compute the new 
  position. As the keplerian propagator, it implements the 
  {@link fr.cs.orekit.propagation.Propagator} interface. 
</p>
	
<p> <h5> Numerical propagation </h5> 
 It is the most important part of the OREKIT project. Based on commons-math
 integrators, the {@link fr.cs.orekit.propagation.numerical.NumericalModel}
 class realizes the interface between space mechanics and mathematical 
 resolutions. If its utilization seems difficult on first sight, it is in 
 fact quite clear and intuitive.
 </p>

<p> The mathematical problem to integrate is a seven dimension time derivative equations
 system. The six first equations are given by the Gauss equations (expressed
 in {@link fr.cs.orekit.orbits.EquinoctialOrbit}) and the 
 seventh is simply the flow rate and mass equation. This first order 
 system is computed by the 
 {@link fr.cs.orekit.propagation.numerical.TimeDerivativesEquations} class.
 It will be instanced by the propagator and then be modified at each step 
 (a fixed t value) by all the needed 
 {@link fr.cs.orekit.propagation.numerical.forces.ForceModel force models} which
 will add their contribution, the perturbing acceleration.
</p>
<p>	The {@link org.apache.commons.math.ode.FirstOrderIntegrator integrators}
 provided by commons-math need the state vector at t0, the state vector first 
 time derivate at t0, and then calculates the next step state vector, and 
 ask for the next first time derivative, etc. until it reaches the final 
 asked date. </p>
