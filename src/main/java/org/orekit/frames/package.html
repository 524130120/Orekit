This package provides classes to handle frames and transforms between them.
	
<p> The {@link org.orekit.frames.Transform} class represents a full
 transform : rotation and translation, and its first time derivative to 
 handle kinematics. 
</p>

<p> 
A {@link org.orekit.frames.Frame} is then defined with a transform from 
an other one, called Parent Frame. So the user can build its own frame tree and then 
OREKIT can calculate any transform between frames. The first root of the tree 
is necessarily the J2000 inertial frame, which is a singleton. In that way, there can
be no exception and every couple of frame has at least a common root in the frame 
tree which is the J2000 reference.
</p>  
<p> 
The frames are time synchronized. To get a transform from one frame to another the
date must be specified, and
{@link org.orekit.frames.Frame#updateFrame(AbsoluteDate)} is internally
called. If a user wants to implement its own date synchronized frame, he has to 
implement by extension his own {@link org.orekit.frames.Frame#updateFrame(AbsoluteDate)}
method.
</p>

<p>
OREKIT provides one specific Earth fixed (and date dependent) frame, the 
International Terrestrial Reference Frame (fixed by the IERS conventions 2003).
