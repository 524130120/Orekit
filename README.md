# Orekit

> An accurate and efficient core layer for space flight dynamics applications

[Orekit](https://www.orekit.org) is a low level space dynamics library written
in Java. Orekit is designed to be easily used in very different contexts, from
quick studies up to critical operations. As a library, Orekit provides basic
elements (orbits, dates, attitude, frames, ...) and various algorithms to
handle them (conversions, propagations, pointing, ...).

## Documentation

Project overview, architecture and development, detailed features list,
tutorials, Javadoc and a lot of other information is available on the
[Maven site](https://www.orekit.org/site-orekit-development/).

## Getting help

The main communication channel is our [forum](https://forum.orekit.org/). You
can report bugs and suggest new features in our
[issues tracking system](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit/orekit/issues).

## Contributing

If you are interested in participating in the development effort, subscribe to
the [forum](https://forum.orekit.org/) and step up to discuss it. The larger
the community is, the better Orekit will be. The main rule is that everything
