* Basic use

** The problem to be solved

  We want to compute the Doppler effect of a satellite with respect to
  a ground station.

** A simple solution

  On the one hand, we define the Local Orbital Frame (LOF) related to the satellite.

  Let's first define some initial state for the satellite with:

  ** an inertial frame

  ** a date in some time scale
    
  ** a central attraction coefficient
    
  ** an orbit defined by the position and the velocity of the satellite in the inertial frame at the date.
    
  []

  The initial orbit is just set as a <CartesianOrbit>. 
  More precisions on the orbit representation can be found
  in the {{{../architecture/orbits.html}orbits section}}
  of the library architecture documentation.

+---------------------
Frame inertialFrame = Frame.getEME2000();
TimeScale utc = UTCScale.getInstance();
AbsoluteDate initialDate =
    new AbsoluteDate(2004, 01, 01, 23, 30, 00.000, utc);
double mu =  3.986004415e+14;
Vector3D position = new Vector3D(-6142438.668, 3492467.560, -25767.25680);
Vector3D velocity = new Vector3D(505.8479685, 942.7809215, 7435.922231);
PVCoordinates pvCoordinates = new PVCoordinates(position, velocity);
Orbit initialOrbit =
    new CartesianOrbit(pvCoordinates, inertialFrame, initialDate, mu);
+---------------------

  As a propagator, we consider a simple <KeplerianPropagator>.

+---------------------
Propagator kepler = new KeplerianPropagator(initialOrbit);
+---------------------

  So, the LOF is all defined, assuming its type to be QSW.

+---------------------
LocalOrbitalFrame lof =
    new LocalOrbitalFrame(inertialFrame, LOFType.QSW, kepler, "LOF");
+---------------------

  On the other hand, let's define the ground station by its coordinates as a <GeodeticPoint> 
  in its own <TopocentricFrame> related to a <BodyShape> in some terrestrial frame.

+---------------------
double longitude = Math.toRadians(45.);
double latitude  = Math.toRadians(25.);
double altitude  = 0.;
GeodeticPoint station = new GeodeticPoint(latitude, longitude, altitude);
double ae =  6378137.0;                // equatorial radius in meter
double f  =  1.0 / 298.257223563;      // flattening
Frame ITRF2005 = Frame.getITRF2005();  // terrestrial frame
BodyShape earth = new OneAxisEllipsoid(ae, f, ITRF2005);
TopocentricFrame staF = new TopocentricFrame(earth, station, "station");
+---------------------

  More precisions on <BodyShape> and <GeodeticPoint> can be found
  in the {{{../architecture/bodies.html}bodies section}}
  of the library architecture documentation.\
  More precisions on <TopocentricFrame> can be found
  in the {{{../architecture/frames.html}frames section}}
  of the library architecture documentation.

  Now, we can simply get the position and velocity of the station,
  which are zero with respect to its frame, in LOF frame at any time
  in one single instruction:

+---------------------
PVCoordinates pv =
    staF.getTransformTo(lof, anyTime).transformPVCoordinates(PVCoordinates.ZERO);
+---------------------

  All the details of the intermediate frames composite motions are hidden to the user.

  Finally, we can get the doppler measurement:

+---------------------
double doppler =
    Vector3D.dotProduct(pv.getPosition(), pv.getVelocity()) / pv.getPosition().getNorm();
+---------------------

  With some computation loop, we got the following results:

+---------------------
          time           doppler (m/s)
2008-10-01T00:00:00.000  -2925.160

2008-10-01T01:30:00.000  -3195.838

* Advanced use

** The problem to be solved

  The problem is related to the one exposed in the <User defined frames> subsection of the
  {{{../architecture/frames.html}frames section}} of the library architecture documentation.
  
  It can be summarized by the following scheme.

[../images/frames2-tutorial.png]

  For a given satellite, GPS measurements for position and velocity,
  expressed in the ITRF2005 frame, are available at any moment.\
  The GPS antenna is fixed with some offset with respect to the satellite reference frame.\
  The attitude of the satellite reference frame with respect to some moving frame related
  to the satellite center of gravity (CoG) is known at any moment.\
  We want to compute for some instant the position and velocity of the CoG
  in the EME2000 inertial frame.

** A smart solution

  The solution provided by OREKIT is detailed above.

  The CoG frame has its origin at the satellite center of gravity and is aligned with EME2000.
  It is linked to its parent EME2000 frame by an a priori unknown transform which depends
  on the current position and velocity. This transform is what we want to compute.

  We first build the frame. We use the identity transform as a simple dummy value, the
  real value which is time-dependent will be recomputed when time is reset:
  
+---------------------
Frame cogFrame = new Frame(Frame.getEME2000(), Transform.IDENTITY, "LOF");
+---------------------

  The satellite frame, with origin also at the CoG, depends on attitude. For the sake of this
  tutorial, we consider a simple inertial attitude here:

+---------------------
Transform cogToSat = new Transform(new Rotation(0.6, 0.48, 0, 0.64, false));
Frame satFrame = new Frame(cogFrame, cogToSat, "sat");
+---------------------

  Finally, the GPS antenna frame is always defined from the satellite
  frame by 2 transforms: a translation and a rotation. Let's set some values:

+---------------------
Transform translateGPS = new Transform(new Vector3D(0, 0, 1));
Transform rotateGPS    = new Transform(new Rotation(new Vector3D(0, 1, 3),
                                                    Math.toRadians(10)));
Frame gpsFrame         = new Frame(satFrame,
                                   new Transform(translateGPS, rotateGPS),
                                   "GPS");
+---------------------

  Let's consider some measurement date in UTC time scale:
  
+---------------------
TimeScale utc = UTCScale.getInstance();
AbsoluteDate date = new AbsoluteDate(2008, 10, 01, 12, 00, 00.000, utc);
+---------------------
            
  Then let's get some satellite position and velocity in ITRF2005
  as measured by GPS antenna at this moment:

+---------------------
Vector3D position = new Vector3D(-6142438.668, 3492467.560, -25767.25680);
Vector3D velocity = new Vector3D(505.8479685, 942.7809215, 7435.922231);
+---------------------

  The transform from GPS frame to ITRF2005 frame at this moment is defined by
  a translation and a rotation. The translation is directly provided by the
  GPS measurement above. The rotation is extracted from the existing tree, where
  we know all rotations are already up to date, even if one translation is still
  unknown. We combine the extracted rotation and the measured translation by
  applying the rotation first because the position/velocity vector are given in
  ITRF frame not in GPS antenna frame:
  
+---------------------
Transform measuredTranslation = new Transform(position, velocity);
Transform formerTransform =
    gpsFrame.getTransformTo(Frame.getITRF2005(), date);
Transform preservedRotation =
    new Transform(formerTransform.getRotation(),
                  formerTransform.getRotationRate());
Transform gpsToItrf =
    new Transform(preservedRotation, measuredTranslation);
+---------------------

  So we can now update the transform from EME2000 to CoG frame.
  
  The <updateTransform> method automatically locates the frames
  in the global tree, combines all transforms and updates the single
  transform between CoG itself and its parent EME2000 frame.

+---------------------
cogFrame.updateTransform(gpsFrame, Frame.getITRF2005(), gpsToItrf, date);
+---------------------

  The frame tree is now in sync. We can compute all position and velocity
  pairs we want:
  
+---------------------
PVCoordinates origin  = PVCoordinates.ZERO;
Transform cogToItrf   = cogFrame.getTransformTo(Frame.getITRF2005(), date);
PVCoordinates satItrf = cogToItrf.transformPVCoordinates(origin);
+---------------------

+---------------------
Transform cogToEme2000   = cogFrame.getTransformTo(Frame.getEME2000(), date);
PVCoordinates satEME2000 = cogToEme2000.transformPVCoordinates(origin);
+---------------------

  As a result, we can compare the GPS measurements to the computed values:
  
+---------------------
GPS antenna position in ITRF2005: {-6142438.668; 3492467.560; -25767.257}
GPS antenna velocity in ITRF2005: {505.8479685; 942.7809215; 7435.9222310}
Satellite position in ITRF2005: {-6142439.167; 3492468.238; -25766.717}
Satellite velocity in ITRF2005: {505.8480179; 942.7809579; 7435.9222310}
Satellite position in EME2000: {6675100.632; -2317238.909; -31506.077}
Satellite velocity in EME2000: {-150.5129516; -532.0397437; 7436.0742692}
+---------------------
