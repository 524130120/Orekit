This independant package provides classes to handle frames and transforms between them.
	
<p> The {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.frames.Transform} class represents a full transform : rotation and 
   translation, and its first time derivative to handle kinematics. 
</p>

<p> A {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.frames.Frame} is then defined with a transform from an other one, called 
    Parent Frame. So the user can build its own frame tree and then OREKIT 
    can calculate any transform between frames. The first root of the tree 
    is necessarily the J2000 inertial frame, which is a singleton. 
    In that way, there can be no exception and every couple of frame has at
    least a common root in the frame tree which is the J2000 reference.
</p>  
<p>
	OREKIT provides one specific Earth fixed frame, the {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.frames.ITRF2000Frame}
	(International 
	Terrestrial Reference Frame fixed by the IERS conventions 2003).
