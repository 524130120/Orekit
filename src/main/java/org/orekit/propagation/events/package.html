This package provides interfaces and classes dealing with events occurring during propagation.
	
<p>
The interface and classes are heavily based on classes with similar names in the ode
package from the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/math/">commons math</a> library.
The changes are mainly adaptations of the signatures to space dynamics.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the type of dependent variable t has been changed from <code>double</code>
      to {@link org.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate AbsoluteDate}</li>
  <li>the type of state vector y has been changed from <code>double[]</code>
      to {@link org.orekit.propagation.SpacecraftState SpacecraftState}</li>
</ul>
