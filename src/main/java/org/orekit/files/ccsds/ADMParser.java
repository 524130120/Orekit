 * Base class for all CCSDS Attitude Data Message parsers.

 * changed, such as reference date for Mission Elapsed Time or Mission Relative
 * Time time systems, or the gravitational coefficient or the IERS conventions,
 * the various {@code withXxx} methods must be called, which create a new
 * immutable instance with the new parameters. This is a combination of the <a
