This independent package provides classes to handle epochs, time scales, and to compare 
instants between them.
	
<p> The principal class is {@link org.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate}
which represents a unique instant in time, with no ambiguity. For that
purpose, the ways to define this object are really precise. </p>

<p>The easiest and most evident way is to define an instant with an offset from an other
 one. OREKIT defines 6 reference epochs, which are the most commonly used by the space
 community :
 <pre>
 
  	  - Julian Epoch : -4712-01-01 at 12:00:00 , TTScale
      - Modified Julian Epoch : 1858-11-17 at 00:00:00, TTScale
      - CNES1950Epoch : 1950-01-01 at 00:00:00,  TTScale
      - GPS Epoch : 1980-01-06 at 00:00:00,  UTCScale    
      - Java Epoch : 1970-01-01 at 00:00:00, TTScale
      - J2000Epoch  : 2000-01-01 at 12:00:00, TTScale

 </pre> 
</p>

<p>The second definition, that can be source of some confusion, is by giving a location
 (a date) in a specific timescale. It is very important to be familiar with the timescales
 definitions to avoid mistakes. OREKIT proposes 4 of the most important ones :
 <pre>
	- TAIScale : International Atomic Time

	- TTScale : Terrestrial Time as defined by IAU(1991) recommendation IV. Coordinate
	  time at the surface of the Earth. It is the successor of Ephemeris Time TE.
	  By convention, TT = TAI + 32.184 s. 
	
	- UTCScale : Coordinated Universal Time. UTC is related to TAI using step adjustments
	  from time to time according to IERS (International Earth Rotation Service) rules. 
	  These adjustments require introduction of leap seconds.
	
	- TGCScale : Geocentric Coordinate Time. Coordinate time at the center of mass of 
	  the Earth. This time scale depends linearly from TTScale.
	
 </pre> 
</p>
 
<p>Once it is built, an {@link org.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate} can be compared 
to other ones, and expressed in other TimeScales. It is used to define states, orbits,
 frames...</p>
