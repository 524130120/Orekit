<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
<p> 
  OREKIT library is a low level libray for space mechanics projects. It is 
implemented in the JAVA language. 
</p>
<p>OREKIT project was initiated by CS with the following goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
 <li>provide a common base layer for space projects</li>
 <li>support both quick developments with loose requirements and complex
     projects with rich physical modeling, fine customization, and high accuracy</li>
 <li>be user-extensible through clear and as simple as possible architecture</li> 
 <li>use unified interfaces to allow models and algorithms switching with almost no effort</li>
 <li>provide both basic and rich models that can be plugged interchangeably to ease
     applications validation</li> 
 <li>separate models configuration from models usage to hide away complexity and keep
     caller code simple</li>
 <li>support both development of standalone and embedded applications (web services,
     plugins, scripting frameworks ...)</li>
 <li>use up-to-date techniques for low cost development and maintenance</li>
 <li>remove platforms and system dependencies and leverage environment-hell
     (environment variables, dynamic libraries versions, operating system,
      filesystem layout ...)</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Features</h2>
<p>
Orekit can be used for many purposes, from simple geometrical or orbital tools 
up to complex orbits propagators with several perturbing forces, maneuvers and
discrete events. Here is a short list of the features offered by the library:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>frames and transform handling</strong>. predefined frames for IERS and
 other common systems, user-extensible, geometrical conversions, time-derivative
 conversion, combinations, fixed, time-dependent and user-driven frames</li>
 <li><strong>time and instants handling</strong>. Absolute dates creation, computation
 and comparison across all epochs (julian, MJD, J2000, 1950, 1970, GPS ...) and time
 scales (TAI, UTC, TT, TU1, TCG ...), automatic and transparent leap seconds support</li>
 <li><strong>space mechanics objects implementation</strong>. Moon, Sun, terrestrial 
 frame ITRF2000, forces (gravity attraction field, third body attraction, 
 sun and atmospheric drag, maneuvers...)</li>
 <li><strong>orbits representation</strong>. Orbital parameters conversions (Keplerian,
 Circular, Cartesian, Equinoctial, Two-Lines)</li>
 <li>orbit propagation
    <ul>
      <li>analytical (Kepler, Eckstein-Heschler, SDP4/SGP4 2006 revision)</li>
      <li>numerical (fixed and adaptive stepsize, fixed and adaptive order, switching functions,
      G-stop, continuous output, several atmospheric models, direct reading of user-provided
      gravity models, several satellite shape models for drag and radiation pressure, continuous
      maneuvers, attitude-dependent models)</li>
      <li>interpolated (file-based, memory-based, integration-based)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
 <li>attitude simulation (inertial, LOF-related, body center pointing, nadir pointing,
 target pointing, yaw compensation, sun pointing, yaw steering ...)</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Dependency</h2>
<p>
OREKIT has only one dependency: the commons-math open-source library (<a
href="http://commons.apache.org/math/">). This library provides mathematical tools for
many purposes: geometry, polynomial equations, differential equations, and more... It
is distributed under the business-friendly Apache Software Licence version 2.0.
</p>
<p>
OREKIT is based on two commons-math packages:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>{@link org.apache.commons.math.geometry}, which provides very useful objects as vectors
   and rotations (internally represented by quaternions)</li>
 <li>{@link org.apache.commons.math..ode}, which provides numerical solutions to solve 
   Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The use of commons-math is hidden in OREKIT as much as possible so users don't 
need to fully master this library. If they wish, they can limit themselves to understanding
the simple classes {@link org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D} and
{@link org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Rotation}, and the interface
{@link org.apache.commons.math.ode.FirstOrderIntegrator}.
