Utils

  The "Utils" package provides useful objects for mathematical or geometrical handlings.

* Utils Presentation
  
  The <PVCoordinates> class is a mere container for a position and a velocity vector.
  It is a very low level object which ought to be used associated with other objects.
  In particular, it does not hold by itself any reference to the frame in which it is
  define and the time at which it has this value. These data should be hold elsewhere.
  
  The <PVCoordinatesProvider> is probably the most ubiquitous interface provided by Orekit.
  It is used to represent almost anything that moves, be it a spacecraft (orbit propagators
  extend this interface), some specific frames (spacecraft frame and topocentric frames
  both implement this interface) or celestial bodies that can be retrieved from ephemerides.

  The <Constants> interface only defines useful constants like Julian day duration,
  standard gravity or Earth physical parameters for several models, it does not define
  any processing method.

  The <SecularAndHarmonic> class is a utility used for fitting orbital parameters
  to linear combination of polynomials and periodic functions, and to either retrieve
  the fitting parameters or compute osculating or mean values (including first and
  second derivatives).
