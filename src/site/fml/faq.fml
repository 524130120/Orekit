      <question>
        Has Orekit already been used?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Yes, it has been used in successful operational missions.
        </p>
        <p>The first operational use of Orekit was for the Automated Transfer
          Vehicle (ATV) mission to International Space station (ISS). Orekit
          was used operationally during the real-time monitoring of the rendez-vous
          phase up to the docking. It continuously recomputed the relative geometry
          of the two spacecrafts using different sensors output to check their
          consistency.
        </p>
        <p>Orekit has also been selected by CNES for its next generation flight
        dynamics systems (project Sirius) in early 2011.

      <question>
        Is Orekit validated?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Some parts are strongly validated, others are validated to a less extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The frames package is one of the best validated ones. The overall mechanism
          (transforms, navigation between frames, kinematics ...) has really been challenged
          a lot, both in theoretical tests and during real life operations. This part was
          extensively used for Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) rendez-vous with International
          Space Station (ISS). It was part of an operational ground program performing real
          time monitoring of the rendez-vous and docking phase. This part has been checked to
          below millimeter level for relative configuration. The reference frames part (ITRF
          and the like) has been validated using public data down to meter-level precision for
          version 3.1, and to centimeter level for the version 4.0.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new round of validation has been done after Orekit 3.1 has been published. Two
          defects have been identified and fixed: the J2000 frame was misaligned with real J2000
          by a constant rotation bias of about 18 milliarcsceonds (it was really GCRF, not J2000)
          and the ITRF2000B implementation was wrong by a time-dependent rotation leading to about
          0.6 meters error for orbits with a semi-minor axis of about 10000km. These errors have
          been fixed as of version 4.0. Our tests show the new frames are compliant with reference
          cases to about 10mm for LEO and 60mm for GEO.
        </p>
        <p>
          The TLE package is also quite well validated, it has been checked against some reference
          data published by Vallado along with his revision of the original spacetrack report, where
          he fixed some errors in the original fortran implementation from Norad.
        </p>
        <p>
          The atmosphere models have also been validated the same way, using published data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The time package has been validated by its unit tests only, but since the behavior is
          simpler it can be checked by hand. The unit tests include a lot of borderline cases
          (for example behavior during the introduction of a leap second).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sun and Moon class for version 3.1 are very low precision and are defined in a
          pseudo-inertial frame with loose definition. They can be compared only with very specific
          software. There accuracy is probably limited to about 10 arcseconds. They have been replaced
          by accurate reference models in the version 4.0.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerical propagation has been validated by CNES independently of the Orekit team against
          some very high accuracy propagators (Zoom). They told us the results were good (down to
          centimeter level for simple force models), but we don't have a thorough breakdown of errors
          for various orbits and force models.
        </p>
        <p>
          Validation is a continuous task for us, we are always working on improving it. We would be
          happy to also have other teams perform independent validation runs. We have already received
          some feedback and new tests cases after the first version has been published.
        </p>

      <question>
        Is Orekit thread-safe?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Versions up to 5.X are <em>not</em> thread-safe. Note that simply wrapping Orekit calls
          in synchronized blocks is not a solution as it completely breaks all data caching features,
          so performances are reduced by a large factor.
        </p>
        <p>
          As thread-safety was an important need for many people, this problem has been addressed and
          starting with version 6.0 many Orekit classes are thread-safe. Note however that some parts
          for which sequential access is natural (like numerical propagators) are <em>not</em> thread
          safe.

      <question>
        When I try to compile orekit, maven cannot find commons-math 2.0-SNAPSHOT, where is it ?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Up to version 4.0, Orekit depended on features of commons-math which were not released
          as of mid 2008, so the dependency was set to 2.0-SNAPSHOT development version.
          This development version was available from Apache subversion repository. Starting
          with version 4.1, Orekit depends only on released versions of Apache commons-math
        </p>
        <p>
          Orekit 4.1 depends on version 2.0 of Apache commons-math.
          Orekit 5.0 depends on version 2.1 of Apache commons-math.
          Orekit 5.1 depends on version 2.2 of Apache commons-math.
