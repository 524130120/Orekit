This package provides interface to represent space 
objects such as stars or planets.
	
<p> Their geometry is represented by a {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.bodies.BodyShape}
 and other informations such as position and mass are represented by
a {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.bodies.ThirdBody}. 
</p>
<p>
Several implementations are provided by OREKIT : 
<pre>
	- {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.bodies.OneAxisEllipsoid}, which represents the ellipsoid shape of space rotating bodies.
	- {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.models.bodies.Moon} and {@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.models.bodies.Sun}, which provides position at a specific date and other informations such as the radius.
</pre>
