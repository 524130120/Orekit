This package provides interface to represent space 
objects such as stars or planets.
	
Their geometry is represented by a {@link org.orekit.bodies.BodyShape}
 and other informations such as position and mass are represented by
a {@link org.orekit.bodies.ThirdBody}. 

<p>
Several implementations are provided by OREKIT : 
<pre>
	- {@link org.orekit.bodies.OneAxisEllipsoid}, which represents the ellipsoid shape of space rotating bodies.
	- {@link org.orekit.models.bodies.Moon} and {@link org.orekit.models.bodies.Sun}, which provide position at a specific date and other informations such as the radius.
