Orekit can be built from source either using maven 2,
ant or eclipse (with the m2eclipse plugin).

Building with Maven 2:
 - Maven 2 can be downloaded here:
       http://maven.apache.org/download.html
 - If you are behind a proxy (which is a traditional
   setting in a corporate environment), then you need
   to configure maven to use it. This is explained
   in the maven documentation here:
   http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html
 - run "mvn package" to automatically download all
   the required dependencies listed in the pom.xml file
   and create a file named target/orekit-x.y.jar where
   x.y is the version number

Building with Ant:
 - Ant can be downloaded here:
       http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
 - either put the commons-math jar in a lib directory
   just below the top-level orekit directory or edit
   the ant build.xml file to edit the get-apache-commons-math
   target that can automatically download commons-math
 - run "ant jar" to create a file named
   build/orekit-x.y.jar where x.y is the version number

Building with Eclipse:
 - Eclipse can be downloaded here:
       http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
 - open orekit as a java project (the eclipse .project
   is already provided with the orekit source distribution)
 - configure the dependencies in the build path as they
   are available in your system (the .classpath file
   is configured to use a maven 2 repository, which may
   not be what you want)
 - build the project as usual using eclipse features
