This package provides spacecraft models useful for the computation of
some perturbative forces.

<p> 
On one side, the interfaces 
({@link fr.cs.orekit.models.spacecraft.AtmosphereDragSpacecraft}
({@link fr.cs.orekit.models.spacecraft.SolarRadiationPressureSpacecraft}
allows retrieval of exact geometrical 
information : surface, drag coefs, etc. as seen by a specific direction.
In fact, this information is very difficult to represent. So only
one model is really implemented, the spherical spacecraft, which 
coefficents doesn't depend on direction. The user can implement its own
model if he needs to.
