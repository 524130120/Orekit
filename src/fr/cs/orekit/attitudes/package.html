This package provides classes to represent simple attitudes.
	
<p> 
Some force models such as the atmospheric drag or the maneuvers need to
know the spacecraft orientation in inertial frame. 
OREKIT uses a standard container for 
{@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.attitudes.AttitudeKinematics attitude kinematics}
(attitude rotation quaternion and instant spin axis) which permits to 
convert vectors from inertial frame to spacecraft frame. 
</p>
<p>
OREKIT does not for the moment propagate or retrieve real attitudes 
with captors information. But it proposes an interface, 
{@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.attitudes.AttitudeKinematicsProvider}, which computes
attitudes depending on time and position. Several ideal attitudes are 
already implemented in the OREKIT library in the package 
{@link fr.cs.aerospace.orekit.attitudes.models} </p>
