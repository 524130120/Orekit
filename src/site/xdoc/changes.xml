    <release version="3.2" date="TBD"
             description="TBD">
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Renamed the iers package into data, as it is not IERS specific anymore.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        The simplified precession-nutation model used for CIRF 2000 frame has been
        enhanced. Its accuracy is similar to the accuracy of the IAU-2000B model
        used in the equinox-based approach (but this simplified model uses the new
        CIO based approach).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        The ITRF 2005 frame is now supported instead of the older ITRF 2000 frame. The
        Earth Orientation Parameters data handling classes have been updated to match
        this change and read the new file format provided by IERS.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        The J2000 frame was slightly mis-oriented (about 20 milli arcseconds). It
        really was the GCRF frame. This has been fixed and now both the GCRF and
        the J2000 are available.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        A lot more classes and interfaces are now serializable, to help users embed
        instance in their own serializable classes.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Changed TimeScale from base abstract class to interface only.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added predefined leap seconds to allow proper turn-key use of the library
        even without an already configured environment. All known leap seconds at
        time of writing (2008) are predefined, from 1972-01-01 to 2009-01-01 (the
        last one has been announced in Bulletin C 36 on 2008-07-04 and is not yet
        present in the UTC-TAI.history published file)
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Improved user-friendliness of the time-scales by changing methods parameters
        types to more easily understandable ones.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Improved user-friendliness of the AbsoluteDate class by adding a few constructors
        and methods for common cases.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Improved the class handling dates: ChunkedDate. Changed a constructor
        to allow building from any reference epoch, not only J200 (thus simplifying
        used of modified julian day), added getMJD() method, added several constants
        JULIAN_EPOCH, MODIFIED_JULIAN_EPOCH, FIFTIES_EPOCH, GPS_EPOCH, J2000_EPOCH
        and JAVA_EPOCH.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added a new time scale: GPSScale.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" due-to="quinput">
        Fixed an overflow error in AbsoluteDate that generated an exception when any
        attempts was made to print dates far away like AbsoluteDate.JULIAN_EPOCH or
        AbsoluteDate.MODIFIED_JULIAN_EPOCH.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added the changes page to the generated site.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        Changed test configuration to always use a new JVM for each test. This prevents
        some false positive to be generated.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="3.1" date="2008-07-16"
             description="This release is the first public release of Orekit."/>
